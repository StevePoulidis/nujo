# Contributing to Nujo

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Nujo. It's people like you that make Nujo such a great tool.

## Ground Rules

### Commit messages
  - "[up:*branch*] *commit-message*" - creating bugs
  - "[fix:*branch*] *commit-message*" - correcting bugs
  - "[rm:*branch*] *commit-message*" - rage quit

### Branching strategy
We are using *Gitflow* as a branching strategy.
We have the following branches:
  - **master** - stable, production ready code; latest stable release
  - **develop** - main branch for developing, all other branches get merged here
  - **feature/feature-name** - implementation of specific features
  - **release/release-tag** - release cycle; a release is made out of the **develop** branch
  - **hotfix/hotfix-name** - fixing important bugs in releases quickly
