# Contibuting to Nujo

## Ground Rules

### Commit messages
  - "[Update] ..." - creating bugs
  - "[Fix] ..." - correcting bugs
  - "[Remove] ..." - rage quit

### Branching strategy
We are using *Gitflow* as a branching strategy.
We have the following branches:
  - **master** - stable, production ready code
  - **develop** - main branch for developing
  - **feature/feature-name** - implementation for specific features
  - **release/release-tag** - release cycle
